# hardware-prefetching-and-branch-prediction

Implementation of a prefetcher and a branch predictor in C++.

The prefetcher implemented was from an article called "Storage efficient hardware prefetching using delta correlating prediction tables",
from authors Grannaes, Marius & Jahre, Magnus & Natvig, Lasse, in 2011. It was published in the Journal of Instruction-Level Parallelism. 13. 1-16. 

The branch predictor was from an article called "Improving branch prediction by dynamic dataflow-based identification of correlated branches from a large global history",
from authors Renju Thomas, Manoj Franklin, Chris Wilkerson, and Jared Stark, in 2003.
It was published in Proceedings of the 30th annual international symposium on Computer architecture (ISCA '03).
